🏡 Boston House Price Prediction 🧮
Welcome to my Boston House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a simple yet insightful implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on the famous Boston Housing Dataset. 📊

🚀 Project Overview
In this project, I have:

➡️ Retrieved the dataset from Kaggle 📂
➡️ Preprocessed and cleaned the data using Pandas and NumPy 🧹
➡️ Visualized data features and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn 📈
➡️ Built and trained a Linear Regression Model using Scikit-learn 🤖
➡️ Designed a basic web interface with HTML & CSS 🌐
➡️ Managed the environment using a Python Virtual Environment in VS Code 💻
